Hi, Welcome to my personal website. 

I am Jiayi Wang, a research scientist at the Beijing Institute for General Artificial Intelligence (BIGAI). I received my PhD degree in robotics from the School of Informatics, The University of Edinburgh in 2023, supervised by [Dr. Steve Tonneau](https://stevetonneau.fr/) and [Prof. Sethu Vijayakumar](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/svijayak/). Previously, I was a PostDoc at the University of Edinburgh (2023-2024), and a research intern at the Italian Institute of Technology (2016-2017). 

My research focuses on **humanoid robotics** and **multi-contact motion planning**, with applications including uneven terrain locomotion and loco-manipulation. I have published in several top-tier journals and conferences, including **T-RO**, **IROS**, and **Humanoids**.

Please feel free to drop me an email if you would like to discuss about research, collaboration, and job opportunities.
