Hi, welcome to my personal website. 

My name is Jiayi Wang. I am a research scientist at the [Beijing Institute for General Artificial Intelligence (BIGAI)](https://eng.bigai.ai/). I received my PhD in robotics from the [Statistical Learning and Motor Control (SLMC) Group](https://informatics.ed.ac.uk/slmc) at the School of Informatics, The University of Edinburgh, in 2023, under the supervision of [Dr. Steve Tonneau](https://stevetonneau.fr/) and [Prof. Sethu Vijayakumar](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/svijayak/). Following my PhD, I worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher at The University of Edinburgh (2023–2024) and previously gained experience as a research intern at the Italian Institute of Technology (2016–2017).

My research focuses on **humanoid robotics** and **multi-contact motion planning**, with applications including uneven terrain locomotion and loco-manipulation. I have published in several top-tier journals and conferences, including **T-RO**, **IROS**, and **Humanoids**.

Please feel free to contact me if you would like to discuss about research, collaboration, and job opportunities.
